5.	Download the .crt and .key files locally and use them along with the credentials in PGAdmin
a.	Copy the files from their location into your home folder `sudo cp /opt/ssl/link.d00.postgres.client.crt ~/`
b.	Change the file permissions so you can download the file (DO THIS ONLY IN THE NEW FILE IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY) example: `sudo chmod 777 link.d00.postgres.client.*`
c.	Download the files using scp from your laptop
d.	Delete the files you created on the server once you’ve downloaded them.
